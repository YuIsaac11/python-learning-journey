# python-learning-journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn Python step by step.
I'll be adding exercises, notes, and mini-projects week by week.

## Goals
- Learn Python fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, files).
- Build small automation projects.
- Transition into cloud (AWS), Docker, and MLOps projects.

## Weekly Progress
- **Week 1:** Python basics (Hello World, variables, lists, dictionaries).
- **Week 2:** Functions, loops, error handling, and file operations.
- **Week 3+:** Small automation scripts and projects.
